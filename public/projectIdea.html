                        The web application (app) ventures into the three-dimensional world of landscaping where the user is able the visualize and store created landscaped areas for complying development. The initial concept for the project is to create an app that calculates the volume of the area to be landscaped Depending on the landscaping material chosen to be used, the app will determine the amount and cost of the material that is required for that area. The app will then store the data and then display the results to the user.

                        During my experience working as a landscaper on construction sites, I observed and retained knowledge when installing landscaped areas. There are multiple layers of landscaping materials used for these areas. These materials included soil, plants, mulch, turf, pebble, sand, and blue metal, each with its own density and cost. The variable density determines the amount of material required for the designated volume. When residential development takes place elements of the natural environment need to be protected and preserved. The size of the property will determine the amount of area that needs to be landscaped as shown in the table below:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6" id="profilePic">

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <h1>Description</h1>
                </div>

                        This becomes more complicated when building blocks of units in high density areas with multiple landscaped areas required on site. The areas will be located at different areas of the site and on different levels of the building which makes it challenging in determining how much landscaping material is required at these various locations. The landscaping material is delivered in 1 Tonne bulker bags. There are cranes set-up at these construction sites that enable these materials to be distributed around the site accordingly if space permits. The app is useful to both project managers and out-sourced landscapers as it enables the user to input multiple landscaped areas and save them in a project list so that you don’t have to repeatedly input calculations every time you are on site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This will enable the user to specify to the crane driver how much material is required at each location. The crane drivers time is very limited as they have to deal with other labourers that require them to move other construction materials around the site so making sure the correct amount of material is disputed accordingly the first time will make things a lot easier than having 1 Tonne of extra material on the top floor after the crane have been taken off site and you have to manually remove the material in the elevator and off site which will cost time and money.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When opening the web application, the user will be presented with the landing page displaying a short gif video demonstrating how the application is utilized. The user is required to register an account to access the application. Once the user is logged in, they are directed to their profile page. From this point the user can access the shape select page where they can choose the shape of their landscaped area. Then they are directed to the calculation page where they are presented with the 3D model of the selected landscaped area. The user can select from a range of materials to fill the volume. The material data is stored in a database. The user enters a name and the dimensions of their volume and clicks on the 'calculate' button which calculates the volume, required amount of material to fill the volume and the cost. The user has the option to change the dimensions and material until they are happy with their inputs.

                    <p>
                        The user can then click on the 'submit' button which will take the data entered and save it to a database. The user is directed to the projects page where a list of their projects can be viewed.To gain access to the details of their projects, the user clicks on their project which will send them to the details page where the information for their landscaped area is displayed. The user can add as many projects as they want and will stay logged in until they choose to logout.

                        User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX): These skills are used in the development of mobile applications and most of the time are skipped due to developers enabling actions instead of satisfying the end users interaction with the app and encouraging it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Design: The application might function as designed but clients and users pay more attention to how the application looks and interacts with them on their devices. Developers need to make sure the application is appealing to the end user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cloud Infrastructure: Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are platforms that utilize global networks of data centres for deployment and management of web applications.

                    <p>
                        Cross-Platform Capabilities: Initially you will choose a specific platform like Android, iOS, or Windows to begin creating the application but eventually you will want your app to be able to run across all platforms. Transferring the coding from one platform to another might prove to be more complicated if not anticipated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data Expertise: Collecting and analysing data will be an important skill to acquire to determine the effectiveness of the app and how many users the app has attracted. This is achieved through efficient databases and repositories.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security: The user’s personal information and data is important to consider when developing an app that requires user register and login functions. You want to gain the users trust by making them feel that their data is safe and won’t be used for other purposes besides what the app will use it for. You need to make sure your systems are protected from outside hackers.

                        There are many current applications that provide the design and calculation function for landscaping materials such as iScape and Landscaping Calculator available on Google Play and the App Store. However, these applications do not send the calculations to databases where they can be stored and sent back to the user and displayed in a projects list where the user can decide to keep or delete the project. Project managers will find it useful because they will be able to conduct their own calculations in the landscaped areas and be able to verify whether out-sourced landscapers are over charging. There are functions that could be added in future development of the application such as allowing the user to add a material if not found in the pull-down menu and being able to share their projects.
