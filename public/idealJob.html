                            The job is looking for a Data Systems Engineer in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Team. The company is Nearmap which produces high resolution images of urban areas, allowing users to stream photos of maps on devices such as desktop, tablets, or mobiles (www.nearmap.com/au/en). The AI section of the platform deals with vectorized maps and 3D models of cities along with data related to those areas. Elements include roof types, swimming pool, trees, lawn grass and the information related to these elements such as area and percentage coverage of the area being viewed. This visual imagery can then be converted into a data-set and sent to a user as rich geospatial (.gpkg) and spreadsheet (.csv) files with links to the source user can refer to and make business decisions for their respective company.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            This job is appealing to me because it deals with linking 3D modelling and data which is similar to my work experience using 3D Modelling programs where I have become aware that creating a structure that can easily be followed and maintained of a complex 3D assembly is important. In every project that I have been involved with, there have been many sub- assemblies which included further sub- assemblies and that the 3D program allowed me to create configurations which only included specific components which assisted when developing the 2D manufacturing drawings. An example of this would be when I divided the hydrated lime mixing system into separate configurations such as Bin Silo, Support Structures, Access Platforms, Pipe Run Layouts in the same assembly and then organised the 2D manufacturing drawings using a numbering system that were linked to the 3D model part and as a result was linked to the Bill of Materials. Also, while working with Joy Mining, I was assigned with updating the 3D models of Roof Bolters when the machinery was brought in for an overhaul as well as integrating the updated components that were integrated into the existing machinery. Instead of creating machinery, I would be involved with creating worlds.
